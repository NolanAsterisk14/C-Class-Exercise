# C-Class-Exercise

I completed an intro course to C++ in college, and the work focused on both quizzing/testing different areas of knowledge involving C++, as well as practical coding exercises.

Sadly, I didn't organize my work very well until a few years into my schooling, nor did I maintain redundant backups of it until some time later. As a result, I lost a signlificant amount of the source code for my exercises when I had my old computer crash and corrupt all my drives.
